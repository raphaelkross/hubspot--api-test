## Debrief

### Code Quality

I would start to use Typescript to add type safety, making the code easier to maintain and allowing developer to catch errors earlier.

Large processing functions mainly at worker.js should be broken into smaller pieces with smaller responsabilities. E.g.: specific functions for fetching data from Hubspot, DTOs for translating raw data into the data that we actually gonna use, mapper/service functions to apply the business logic and create relations across data (contact <> meetings).

Error handling classes can be used instead default try-catch blocks, since they are useful in case we want to add better observability.

### Project Architecture

The current implementation has no folders for organization, we could implement a service layer pattern, separating Hubspot integration from the data processing logic.

Each entity could have its own service (contacts, companies, meetings) and own the business logic.

For better scalability, an event-driven architecture using message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ) can make the system more resilient and async.

### Performance

The sequential processing of entities is a major bottleneck.

Parallel processing of different Hubspot accounts using worked threads or separate process and using configurable chunk sizes instead the fixed 2000-record limit can improve performance.

On database, bulk upserts could be used instead individual writes and the usage of a cache layer (Redis) for frequently access data would reduce the number of API calls for Hubspot.

Retry mechanisms and rate limit should also be considered to handle instability (from database or Hubspot) situations.
